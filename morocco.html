      It is also where people live, work, and go to school. Ask yourself if you were on the other side of the camera what would you want to happen?<br>
      Winding off of the main streets where goods are for sale are smaller streets (called derbs) that are residential. Mixed in to the workshops and homes are restaurants, food shops, and street vendors. There truly is a little bit of everything. There’s even more happening that goes beyond what you will see from the street of the famous market in Marrakech.

    <p><b>But what if I get lost in the medina?</b></p>
    <b>The question isn’t if you get lost, the question is how soon you’ll get lost.</b>

    <p>
      It took me over a year to finally get my bearings and learn how to navigate the streets of the souk. For first-time visitors it’s inevitable. Go into the experience knowing you’re likely to get lost and accept it as part of having a Marrakech experience! Don’t panic if ever you find yourself getting lost in Marrakech night market. You’ll find signs scattered through the souks with arrows pointing to Jemma el Fna so if you truly want to get out and are lost just follow the signs or ask someone to point you in the right direction.

    <h2>Camping and RV'ing in Morocco</h2>
    <p>Finding electrical plugins and water hookups may prove to be the most difficult. Outside of a campground you likely won’t find exterior hookups. It’s however not uncommon to see campers parked overnight in parking lots. If you need to wash laundry, there aren’t self-service Laundromats however you can take your clothes to be washed at a laundry service for a relatively small fee.</p>
    <p>
      Towering kasbahs, luxurious riad gardens, and sumptuous hotel rooms are all a part of the travelers imagination when it comes to Morocco. However, for those who prefer something a little less expensive and closer to nature camping and RVing sound closer to their dreams. Morocco is not as camping friendly as the United States or Europe however there are more and more locations catering to visitors who prefer sleeping under the stars.

      Morocco has several national parks like Al Hoceima National Park and Toubkal National Park. These are protected wildlife refuges and are great for climbing, hiking, and camping. You will want to take weather into consideration. Contrary to popular belief, not all of Morocco is warm and sunny year round. Autumn and winter months can be quite cold, especially at higher elevations. Remember it does snow in the High Atlas Mountains. Further south the Anti-Atlas mountains are more rocky and the opposite weather extreme needs to be monitored. It can become extremely hot as you approach the Sahara desert

    <p><b>Wildlife to Worry About</b></p>
    <p>Morocco does have scorpions and snakes. In rural areas wild boars and monkeys are also worth keeping in mind. Tent camping proves a little more troublesome when thinking of these creatures. Make sure to keep your food sealed and put away. Pick up and get rid of all garbage especially at night. Scorpions are found in the warmer areas and when the nights get cold they look for warm places to curl up, so it’s worth shaking out your sleeping bag before going to bed and storing your bedding rolled up during the day.</p>
    <p><b>Have you camped in Morocco? I’d love to hear your experience!</b></p><br>
